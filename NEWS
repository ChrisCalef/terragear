New in 0.0.4
* December 19, 2000
* We now have a much more robust "point in a polygon" routine
  (i.e. finds a random point inside a polygon, but not inside a hole
  in that polygon.)
* Removed the mat3.h dependencies.
* Increased maximum area types to 128 for future expandability
* Added road and railroad area types.
* Added a new library for reading ArcInfo e00 files (DCW, GeoGratis).
* Added a new prep util for creating textured polygons from e00 line
  data (i.e. for roads, railroads, streams, utility lines, etc.)
* Added support for the USGS global land use / loand cover raster data base.
* Better MSVC support.
* Better Cygwin support.
* Weight face normals by triangle area when calculating terrain node normals.
* Screen for very small or degenerate triangles which could blow up our face
  normal calculations.
* Fixed a bug which could cause a real mess in the scenery when an
  airport (or hole area) lay on top of a tile corner.
* Clip all land use data to GSHHS land mask so that lower res data won't
  mess up our coast lines.
* Add in support for GSHHS lakes, islands, and ponds.
* Updated stats for parallel scenery build server.
* Added a new option, --cover, to fgfs-construct and
  fgfs-tools-client.  The option takes an argument giving the location
  of the land-cover raster file; if it is not specified, land-cover is
  not built.
* Increased max node count per tile to 4000.
* Fixed a problem with dividing the tile up into land use areas
  (original scheme left really tiny slivers on the edges.)
* Landcover/landuse changes by david megginson to group like chunks
  together into a single polygon.
* Additional degeneracy and bad polygon screening.
* Updates to ShapeDecode to handle NOAA landuse/cover shape files.
* Tile constructor util will now accept an arbitrary list of
  directories to search for input data (so these don't have to be hardcoded.)
* tracked down some "point in a contour" bugs.  The terrain was
  stressing this code more that airports (which was where the code was
  developed.)
* Built a generalized polygon tesselater out of Shewchuk's triangulator.
* Added a routine to calculate the area of an arbitrary 3d triangle.
* Bug fixes in the airport generator util.
* Added a test program for the triangulator.
* Added a print_tri_data() routine to dump complete triangulator data
  structure to screen.
* Added a zero_triangulateio() routine to zero a struct before use.
* Fixed a bug in Shewchuk's triangulator.  This code does a lot of
  malloc()'ing of space, and in some cases blindly expects the results
  to be zero'd out, even though this may not be gauranteed.  We now
  explicitely zero out these critical memory locations after it is
  malloc()'ed.
* Added precision runway markings, switched how textures were applied
  (rotated them by 90 degrees.)
* Updated runway texture layout in designator block.
* Write out the AirportArea hole that has been segmented so it fits with the
  airport model that goes inside the hole in the terrain.
* Handle too-short visual runways for now by converting them to simple runways.
* Handle concrete textures as well as turf and dirt runways.
* Added non-precision and visual runway markings.
* Added code to chop up extra long line segments.
