************************************************************************
This is a sample file for adding user-defined land-use data.

There are three types of data that you can add: points, lines, and
polygons.  All of these get turned into polygons for scenery
generation.  Use a file like this to add missing roads, towns,
villages, lakes etc. for your own scenery with tguserdef.

  First we'll add some small towns missing from vmap0.

  For each point, we need to specify a single geographical
  location in degrees (lon/lat), the width of the area in meters,
  and the area material (see $FG_ROOT/materials.xml).  The first
  example adds a small town 1km x 1km, and the following ones add
  small towns 500m x 500m.  The name is optional, but you'll find
  it useful for keeping track of things.

  Don't try too hard to be exact.  I find two decimal places (about
  1km) to be as accurate as I can usually manage from sectional
  charts; if you go to three decimal places, you'll have 100m
  accuracy, which should almost always be good enough.

  Next, we'll add a missing county road.

  You need to specify the points (lon/lat) that the line will pass
  through, the material type, and the width in meters.  By switching the
  material, you could make (say) a river or railroad instead of a
  road.

  Again, don't try to hard to get every bend in the road; add points
  only for major changes in direction.

  <v>
   -75.72 45.13
   -75.77 45.11
   -75.90 45.03
  </v>
 </line>

 <!--
  Finally, we'll add a missing urban area.

  A polygon can contain multiple contours, some of which can be holds
  (say, to create a donut shape).  Simply specify the lon/lat points
  around the outside of each contour, and try to capture the rough
  shape of the area.  By switching types, you could use this to add
  a park, forest or lake.
